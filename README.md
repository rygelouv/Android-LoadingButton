## Android LoadingButton

Android LoadingButton is very a small library that let you create a button with a loading state
and that may improve the UX of your app

Use this library if you don't have enough space to show a progress loading on your screen
or you dont want to bother with any of that. Android LoadingButton will take care of the 
loading state for you. And you know what? you can customize the look and feel of the button (almost) as you want

The library also prevent user from clicking several times on the button when you just want 
to trigger an event on the first click.

When the button is clicked on, it is passed to a disabled state and a small circular progressbar shows up inside the button
and you have the ability to change the button text during the loading process.
After the loading is done, the progress is dismissed, the button comes back to an enabled state
and you can also change the text.

**This library does not use any other library to do its job. So it's a very small and lightweight library**

Add it to your build.gradle with:
```gradle
allprojects {
    repositories {
        maven { url "https://jitpack.io" }
    }
}
```
and:

```gradle
dependencies {
    compile 'com.github.rygelouv:Android-LoadingButton:1.2.0'
}
```

        custom:text="Validate"
        custom:textColor="@android:color/white"
        custom:background="@drawable/button_accent_full"
        custom:textSize="12sp"
        android:layout_margin="16dp"
        custom:progressColor="@android:color/white"
        />
